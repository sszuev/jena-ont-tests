# Apache Jena OntModel Tests

This is a collection of tests on `org.apache.jena.ontology.OntModel`.
These tests represent a contract for `OntModel` (Jena), 
which is used when developing a new version of `OntModel` (ONT-API), 
see https://github.com/sszuev/jena-owl2    

Most of the tests are copy-pasted and refactored code from the Jena Core sources.
